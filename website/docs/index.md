#Community Created Maps of India
Community Created Maps of India sourced from different government websites which are freely available to all the Indians. Here we have digitized them, cleaned them, added appropriate attributes so it can be used by all the researchers, students etc

All the boundaries are available in geojson or shapefile (WGS84, EPSG4326) format. The below table gives you the status of the data as we clean and upload. Data is not perfect there as many errors both in data and boundaries. You can contribute by sending the pull requests. Please use the census names when correcting the attributes and geojson for shapes. Refer [CONTRIBUTING](/contributing) for ways to contribute.
