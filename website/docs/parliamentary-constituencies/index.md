# India - Parliamentary Constituencies

Parliamentary constituency boundaries data generated, cleaned, and verified at the [OpenDataCamp Bangalore Hackathon, 2014](http://odc.datameet.org/odcblr2014).

           
Before using this data, please note the following:
 
 1. The Parliamentary Constituencies for the states of  Jammu And Kashmir, Jharkhand, Assam, Manipur, Nagaland & Arunachal Pradesh, appear to be pre-delimitation boundaries.
 2. There is some shift in the data.
 3. Some Parliamentary Constituencies Names seem to be incorrect or Missing.
 4. The Parliamentary Constituencies in the State of Telengana are still marked as belonging to Andhra Pradesh
 5. The Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh,  Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, 
 and Lakshadweep do not have a state assembly.
